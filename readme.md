Optimizing ANN hyperparameters to increase recognition accuracy
using Random search and Adaptive boosting 

*make sure to run the ipynb files on environments such as colab or kaggle
upload the notebooks there and execute.
it would take long to execute on local machine so using gpu on colab would be great. 
there are two solutions to better demonstrate and get a grasp of optimisation strategies
the first solution focuses on mnist dataset while the second one focuses on yale dataset
by running the notebooks you will get a better understanding of the approach used
